Trump is shown from the chest up, wearing a dark suit jacket, white shirt, and a bright red tie. He is speaking into a microphone which is angled up towards his mouth.  His expression is serious, and his mouth is slightly open. He appears to be mid-sentence.\n\nThe sign he holds is angled slightly toward the viewer, and dominates the right portion of the frame. The sign is dark with gold and light-teal lettering and accents. In large, bold white letters, it reads: \"Reciprocal Tariffs.\" Below this, a graphic depicting the Presidential Seal of the United States is present.  A two-column table follows, with the header “Country” in the first column and “Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A.” in the second.  The list of countries includes China, the European Union, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, and the United Kingdom. The percentages listed in the “Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A.” column vary, ranging from 39% (European Union) to 97% (Cambodia). A smaller, partially obscured third column on the sign appears to list another set of related percentages.\n\nIn the background, a portion of an American flag is slightly out of focus.

        "url": "Donald Trump is unpredictable. After urging Americans to ‘be cool’ amid markets slumping over his tariff policy, he made a shocking pivot on Wednesday. He announced a 90-day pause for all countries except China. But what led the US president to change his mind? Was it the rapid rise in government bond yields or the rising criticism from billionaires and business leaders? read more\n\nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick look on in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9. Trump announced that he was pausing the higher tariffs on countries, barring China, for 90 days. AFP\n\n“Don’t be weak, don’t be stupid, don’t be a panican,” US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday, in response to a growing number of people expressing concern over his tariff policy.\n\nThe following day, he told Republicans, “I know what the hell I’m doing” as the massive tariffs he had imposed sent global markets into a tailspin. Moreover, he also revelled in the fact that world leaders were “dying to make a deal”, adding that they were “kissing my a*s.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, Trump once again wrote a social media post, “Be cool. Everything is going to work out well,” in response to his tariffs.\n\nBut hours later, he shocked the world and his own people when he announced a 90-day pause in the higher rate of “reciprocal tariffs”, barring China, that had been in force for a mere 13 hours. When asked what brought about the turnaround, Trump said, “They were getting yippy. They were getting a little bit yippy, a little afraid.”\n\nAs the markets jump back following Trump’s reversal, we take a closer look at what exactly led the US president to change his mind on his pet topic — tariffs.\n\nMarkets matter — they really do\n\nIf there was one driving factor behind Trump’s tariff reversal it has to be the markets and how they have performed since April 2 — the day he announced his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.\n\nWhen the tariffs went into effect last Wednesday, the markets tanked. Then came investor fears of a ‘ Black Monday’. It is reported that Trump’s tariffs wiped off $10 trillion (£7.8 trillion) of global share prices in a matter of days.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. AFP\n\nBut that didn’t rattle the US president, much.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, things drastically changed for Trump. The US witnessed a sharp sell-off in US government bond markets, which is usually a safe corner for investors. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time, the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was of particular concern to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, whose finance career was deeply intertwined with the bond market. According to one administration official, it was Bessent who then urged Trump to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market.\n\nLater, while announcing his 90-day pause, Trump even acknowledged the bond market, saying, “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event with auto racing champions at the South Portico of the White House on Wednesday after announcing a pause in the tariffs. AP\n\nCriticism rings loud and clear\n\nBut the markets weren’t the sole factor influencing Trump’s decision on the tariff pause. Trump also was contending with massive criticism from business leaders, billionaires — people he could normally bank on for support.\n\nFor instance, billionaire hedge fund boss and previously a Trump backer — Bill Ackman — turned on the president, warning that his tariffs risked an “economic nuclear winter”.\n\nIn fact, Ackman, as The Telegraph reports, is the origin of Trump’s 90-day pause. He had earlier taken to social media, asking Trump to put a 90-day pause on tariffs, arguing the president can “accomplish his objectives without destroying small businesses in the short term”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, issued a dire warning of what could happen if the tariffs weren’t halted immediately. “If the president doesn’t pause the effect of the tariffs soon, many small businesses will go bankrupt,” Ackman wrote. “Medium-sized businesses will be next.”\n\nTrump’s ‘First Buddy’ Elon Musk also seemed to be unhappy with the tariff policy. Trump’s Doge leader had spent recent days slamming the tariff decision and mocking Peter Navarro, the president’s advisor on trade matters, in deeply personal terms. In fact, Musk went as far as calling Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.\n\nAnd it seems that JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also played an instrumental role in changing Trump’s mind. On Wednesday, around 8 am, Trump watched the Dimon give an interview to Fox News in which he cautioned that a recession was a “likely outcome” given the economic uncertainty, explaining that he was hearing from most everyone he spoke to that they were “cutting back” as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right,” Dimon told Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo. He added, “I’m taking a calm view, but I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here.”\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speak with the media about tariffs at the White House in Washington. Reuters\n\nDeal mania runs high in the White House\n\nIt’s also reported that the tariff pause came as Trump’s team struggled to cope with the countries trying to make a deal. As The Times reported, they simply could not cope with the whirlwind that Trump had unleashed.\n\nMoreover, executives had been flooding the phone lines of Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to make the case to Trump directly.\n\nIn a Bloomberg report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that the flood of outreach from other countries making “the right kind of offers” also played a role. The media outlet reported that Trump was particularly intrigued that countries were beginning to offer concessions that hadn’t previously been on the table, including addressing non-tariff trade barriers. “It just became crazy, the amount of calls we got,” Lutnick said.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, explaining the pause on tariffs. AP\n\nTrump reverses his decision\n\nAll of this put together led to Trump swaying and he decided that he would pause the tariffs. Trump then sat down with Lutnick and Bessent and drafted a social media post to tell the world that he was, for now, rolling back the tariffs.\n\nAfter the announcement, Trump aides raced to declare that it had been the strategy all along. Bessent said the change of tack wasn’t driven by market volatility, and was instead about a desire to tailor new trade deals with affected trading partners that have been flooding the White House with requests to negotiate. “It is just a processing problem,” said Bessent. “Each one of these solutions is going to be bespoke, it is going to take some time, and President Trump wants to be personally involved, so that’s why we’re giving the 90-day pause.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump later said that the decision to change course on his tariff plan came “from the heart”. He said, “Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it. I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up, I didn’t — we didn’t have the use of — we didn’t have access to lawyers … We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too.”\n\nTrump’s decision has definitely given the world some breathing space — at least for the next 90 days. What comes next, no one knows.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

These tariffs were part of his \"America First\" policy, aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit and protecting domestic industries. The USTR and Federal Register would provide official documentation of these tariff increases.

        "round1": {
            "deepseek_response": "Claim is: Donald Trump increased tariffs to show he is greater than other countries.\nOpponent's response: \n\nDonald Trump's increase of tariffs during his presidency was multifaceted and driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Economic Protectionism**: Tariffs were implemented to protect domestic industries, particularly in sectors like steel and aluminum, under the guise of national security. This was aimed at reducing reliance on foreign imports and encouraging the return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**: The tariffs, especially those imposed on China, were part of a broader strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and address issues such as intellectual property theft. This approach was part of Trump's \"America First\" policy, aiming to renegotiate trade deals on more favorable terms for the U.S.\n\n3. **Political Messaging**: Trump's administration framed these tariff increases as assertive moves to project U.S. strength and leadership in international trade. This narrative aligned with his campaign promises to put America first and appeal to his voter base concerned about globalization and job losses.\n\n4. **Global Economic Impact**: While the intention was to strengthen the U.S. economy and negotiating position, the tariffs also led to trade wars, with other countries imposing retaliatory measures. This had mixed effects, including higher consumer prices and economic tensions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the primary motivations for increasing tariffs were economic and strategic, the manner in which these actions were presented and framed by Trump's administration also served to project U.S. dominance on the global stage. Thus, the tariff increases were both a strategic economic move and a tool for projecting national strength.",
            "llama_response": "Claim is: Donald Trump increased tariffs to show he is greater than other countries.\nOpponent's response: While the opponent provides a more nuanced explanation of the motivations behind Trump's tariff increases, I'd like to engage with their argument by pushing for even stronger evidence and exploring potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Engaging with the Argument:**\nThe opponent's response acknowledges the complexity of Trump's motivations but still frames his actions as driven by a mix of economic protectionism, trade strategy, and political messaging. To substantiate this claim, I'd like to see more direct evidence from credible sources.\n\n**Demand for Specific Evidence:**\n\n1. **Primary Sources:** Can you provide direct quotes or statements from Trump, his administration, or other key officials that explicitly link the tariff increases to asserting U.S. dominance or projecting national strength? I'm looking for primary sources like speeches, press briefings, or government reports that support this narrative.\n2. **Economic Impact Studies:** The opponent mentions the \"mixed effects\" of the tariffs, including higher consumer prices and economic tensions. Can you cite specific economic analyses or studies that quantify these effects and assess the overall economic impact of the tariffs? I'm interested in seeing data from reputable organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, or the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n3. **Global Economic Trends:** How does the opponent's argument take into account the broader global economic context during Trump's presidency? Was the U.S. facing increasing economic competition from other major powers, or was it simply seeking to renegotiate trade deals to level the playing field? Can you provide evidence from global economic reports or analyses that supports this claim?\n4. **Comparative Analysis:** Has the opponent considered the potential for Trump's actions to be driven by factors other than \"showing he is greater\" or asserting U.S. dominance? For example, could the administration's protectionist policies be driven by more pragmatic concerns about softening economic data, rising debt levels, or other economic realities? Should we not consider alternative explanations for the administration's actions, even if they are less palatable to Trump's critics?\n\n**Improved Request for Evidence:**\nTo strengthen the claim that Trump's tariff increases were motivated by a desire to assert U.S. dominance, I need more evidence from credible sources that directly supports this narrative. Without additional evidence, it remains unclear whether this was a primary or secondary motivation behind the administration's actions. Can you provide specific sources to justify this claim?\n\n\n\nIn addition, the way this topic is worded almost always invites a critical look into Trump's motivations, which inevitably circles around a \"greater than\" mind-set. Because of this, considering sources from the *right wing* or the *conservative* makes just about any reasoning questionable on the subject of Trump's greatness claims.",
