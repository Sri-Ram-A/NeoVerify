The protests, largely led by young people, reflect growing dissent despite fears of retaliation. Meanwhile, after an eleven-week blockade, Israel allowed nearly 200 aid trucks into Gaza this week, carrying flour, baby food, and medical supplies. However, UN officials claim much of the aid remains undelivered due to security and distribution issues. Besides, Israel continues its military campaign, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to disarm Hamas and control Gaza, as peace talks remain in a deadlock. Watch the video for more.

Don't worry, I'll summarize our discussion and provide a final response:\n\nWe've been evaluating the claim that \"Israel resumed its attacks on Gaza on Monday night\" through a critical debate framework. I asked you to verify the claim with specific, authoritative sources, and we explored various approaches to establishing the claim's credibility.\n\nYou provided a structured response that considered reputable news sources, official statements, cross-referencing information, and contextual consideration. However, I questioned the assumption that only \"reputable news sources\" can provide accurate information and suggested considering alternative sources, such as academic research, independent investigation reports, and eyewitness accounts.\n\nI also proposed evaluating the credibility of each source and considering the quality and quantity of evidence presented. Additionally, I suggested seeking out additional context and background information to provide a more nuanced understanding of the conflict.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, I think your original assessment of the claim's unverifiability was well-founded. Unfortunately, without more information or credible sources confirming the specific attacks, the claim remains unverified.\n\nIf you'd like to continue the discussion or provide more context, I'm happy to engage with you.",

Claims of such a significant scale require attention to detail, ensuring accuracy, and transparent sourcing.\n\nConsidering your previous response to the original claim, I would recommend searching for official reports from reputable organizations, such as:\n\n1. **UN Humanitarian Affairs Service (OCHA):** As an authoritative source for humanitarian information, OCHA might provide data on casualties and affected populations.\n2. **Gaza's Ministry of Health:** Given its direct involvement in documenting medical cases, the Ministry of Health might offer credible information on the number of fatalities and injuries.\n3. **Red Cross or Red Crescent:** As neutral humanitarian organizations, they may provide independent assessments of the situation and corresponding casualty numbers.\n\nTo support the claim, please provide a concrete link or source to these or similar organizations confirming the number of casualties since Monday night's alleged attacks.\n\nAs we've previously discussed, claims of this magnitude require robust evidence to be taken seriously.

There might be some confusion with the name or its location.\n2. **Harnunis:** As I couldn't find any information on a place called \"Harnunis,\" this might be a fictional or non-existent location.\n\nTo confirm Saqib's identity and his association with NASA Hospital (if it exists), I would recommend seeking credible sources directly related to NASA or the supposed hospital, such as:\n\n1. **NASA's official website or press releases:** A search for any information related to NASA hospitals or employees in Harnunis might reveal more information.\n2. **Local health authorities:** Contacting local health authorities in the area where Harnunis is supposed to be located might provide more insight into the existence of the hospital and its staff.\n3. **Professional directories or online listings:** Checking reputable online directories, such as DoctorBase or Healthgrades, might help verify Saqib's medical credentials and employment.\n\nIn the absence of concrete evidence, these claims seem to be unfounded.
