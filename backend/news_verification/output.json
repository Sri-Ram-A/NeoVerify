        "url": "Donald Trump is unpredictable. After urging Americans to ‘be cool’ amid markets slumping over his tariff policy, he made a shocking pivot on Wednesday. He announced a 90-day pause for all countries except China. But what led the US president to change his mind? Was it the rapid rise in government bond yields or the rising criticism from billionaires and business leaders? read more\n\nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick look on in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9. Trump announced that he was pausing the higher tariffs on countries, barring China, for 90 days. AFP\n\n“Don’t be weak, don’t be stupid, don’t be a panican,” US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday, in response to a growing number of people expressing concern over his tariff policy.\n\nThe following day, he told Republicans, “I know what the hell I’m doing” as the massive tariffs he had imposed sent global markets into a tailspin. Moreover, he also revelled in the fact that world leaders were “dying to make a deal”, adding that they were “kissing my a*s.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, Trump once again wrote a social media post, “Be cool. Everything is going to work out well,” in response to his tariffs.\n\nBut hours later, he shocked the world and his own people when he announced a 90-day pause in the higher rate of “reciprocal tariffs”, barring China, that had been in force for a mere 13 hours. When asked what brought about the turnaround, Trump said, “They were getting yippy. They were getting a little bit yippy, a little afraid.”\n\nAs the markets jump back following Trump’s reversal, we take a closer look at what exactly led the US president to change his mind on his pet topic — tariffs.\n\nMarkets matter — they really do\n\nIf there was one driving factor behind Trump’s tariff reversal it has to be the markets and how they have performed since April 2 — the day he announced his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.\n\nWhen the tariffs went into effect last Wednesday, the markets tanked. Then came investor fears of a ‘ Black Monday’. It is reported that Trump’s tariffs wiped off $10 trillion (£7.8 trillion) of global share prices in a matter of days.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. AFP\n\nBut that didn’t rattle the US president, much.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, things drastically changed for Trump. The US witnessed a sharp sell-off in US government bond markets, which is usually a safe corner for investors. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time, the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was of particular concern to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, whose finance career was deeply intertwined with the bond market. According to one administration official, it was Bessent who then urged Trump to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market.\n\nLater, while announcing his 90-day pause, Trump even acknowledged the bond market, saying, “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event with auto racing champions at the South Portico of the White House on Wednesday after announcing a pause in the tariffs. AP\n\nCriticism rings loud and clear\n\nBut the markets weren’t the sole factor influencing Trump’s decision on the tariff pause. Trump also was contending with massive criticism from business leaders, billionaires — people he could normally bank on for support.\n\nFor instance, billionaire hedge fund boss and previously a Trump backer — Bill Ackman — turned on the president, warning that his tariffs risked an “economic nuclear winter”.\n\nIn fact, Ackman, as The Telegraph reports, is the origin of Trump’s 90-day pause. He had earlier taken to social media, asking Trump to put a 90-day pause on tariffs, arguing the president can “accomplish his objectives without destroying small businesses in the short term”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, issued a dire warning of what could happen if the tariffs weren’t halted immediately. “If the president doesn’t pause the effect of the tariffs soon, many small businesses will go bankrupt,” Ackman wrote. “Medium-sized businesses will be next.”\n\nTrump’s ‘First Buddy’ Elon Musk also seemed to be unhappy with the tariff policy. Trump’s Doge leader had spent recent days slamming the tariff decision and mocking Peter Navarro, the president’s advisor on trade matters, in deeply personal terms. In fact, Musk went as far as calling Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.\n\nAnd it seems that JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also played an instrumental role in changing Trump’s mind. On Wednesday, around 8 am, Trump watched the Dimon give an interview to Fox News in which he cautioned that a recession was a “likely outcome” given the economic uncertainty, explaining that he was hearing from most everyone he spoke to that they were “cutting back” as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right,” Dimon told Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo. He added, “I’m taking a calm view, but I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here.”\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speak with the media about tariffs at the White House in Washington. Reuters\n\nDeal mania runs high in the White House\n\nIt’s also reported that the tariff pause came as Trump’s team struggled to cope with the countries trying to make a deal. As The Times reported, they simply could not cope with the whirlwind that Trump had unleashed.\n\nMoreover, executives had been flooding the phone lines of Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to make the case to Trump directly.\n\nIn a Bloomberg report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that the flood of outreach from other countries making “the right kind of offers” also played a role. The media outlet reported that Trump was particularly intrigued that countries were beginning to offer concessions that hadn’t previously been on the table, including addressing non-tariff trade barriers. “It just became crazy, the amount of calls we got,” Lutnick said.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, explaining the pause on tariffs. AP\n\nTrump reverses his decision\n\nAll of this put together led to Trump swaying and he decided that he would pause the tariffs. Trump then sat down with Lutnick and Bessent and drafted a social media post to tell the world that he was, for now, rolling back the tariffs.\n\nAfter the announcement, Trump aides raced to declare that it had been the strategy all along. Bessent said the change of tack wasn’t driven by market volatility, and was instead about a desire to tailor new trade deals with affected trading partners that have been flooding the White House with requests to negotiate. “It is just a processing problem,” said Bessent. “Each one of these solutions is going to be bespoke, it is going to take some time, and President Trump wants to be personally involved, so that’s why we’re giving the 90-day pause.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump later said that the decision to change course on his tariff plan came “from the heart”. He said, “Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it. I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up, I didn’t — we didn’t have the use of — we didn’t have access to lawyers … We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too.”\n\nTrump’s decision has definitely given the world some breathing space — at least for the next 90 days. What comes next, no one knows.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

His administration imposed tariffs on various imported goods, particularly from China, as part of a strategy to address perceived unfair trade practices and protect American industries. These actions were part of his \"America First\" policy, aiming to support domestic manufacturing and correct trade imbalances.\n\nTo confirm the specifics, official sources such as the U.S. Trade Representative's office and government reports from the Trump administration provide detailed information on the tariffs imposed. Additionally, credible news outlets covered these developments extensively, offering insights into the rationale and impact of the tariff increases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent and specifics can be verified through official documents and credible news sources, the fact that Trump increased tariffs is confirmed.",
            "llama_response": "Claim is: Donald Trump purposefully increased tariffs.\nOpponent's response: That conclusion seems too hasty for a claim that involves complex economic motivations and the nuances of deliberate policy decisions.\n\nFirst, consider the complexity of \"purposely increasing tariffs.\" While the Trump administration indeed imposed tariffs on various imported goods, it's essential to differentiate between protectionist policies intended to support domestic industries and actions taken in response to broader economic and trade pressures.\n\nThe phrase \"perceived unfair trade practices\" introduces an interpretive layer that demands more concrete evidence. Can you provide specific instances of trade practices that Trump believed to be unfair, and how his administration quantified or measured these abuses? We're seeking more than general assertions of \"perceived\" practices.\n\nFurthermore, statements citing a broad policy goal like \"America First\" are insufficient to establish deliberate intent behind specific tariff decisions. I'd need to see documentation from the U.S. Trade Representative's office illustrating specific, targeted actions aimed directly at achieving this policy objective.\n\nWhile credible news outlets carried extensive coverage of the tariff developments, their articles are indirect sources. I challenge you to draw direct evidence from **official reports** and **primary documents** from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, such as quarterly reports on trade negotiations or data on tariffs imposed. Does the administration have publicly available records detailing the decision-making process behind these tariffs? \n\nTo conclusively establish that Trump \"purposefully increased tariffs,\" we require direct access to documents outlining his administration's decision-making, including any reasoning, criteria used for targeting specific products, and an analysis of the associated impact on American industries.\n\nCan you **point to specific, verifiable government reports** that establish the deliberate intent behind these actions, linking tariff increases directly to Trump's administration goals?",

To decisively conclude the specific **intent behind the tariffs**, I'd still need **direct quotes from Trump** on these issues. While officials close to him make statements, a quote would provide invaluable clarity on whether the intent aligns with broader policy goals or was a straightforward economic calculation.\n\nOnce we've narrowed these gaps, the evidence does offer a compelling picture of deliberate action by the Trump administration to address trade imbalances through tariffs.

The U.S. Trade Representative's office and statements from administration officials provide evidence of this intent. However, direct quotes from Trump himself would offer the clearest confirmation of his personal intent, strengthening the argument further.",
            "llama_response": "Claim is: Donald Trump purposefully increased tariffs.\nOpponent's response: I think we've reached a point of relative agreement on the evidence supporting this claim. The **organized presentation of direct quotes and official reports** provides substantial context and indicates a clear intent behind the tariffs.\n\nWhile asking for **direct quotes from Trump** would indeed strengthen the argument, I'm willing to accept the evidence as is. It's reasonable to assert that the **intent behind the tariffs** aligns with broader policy goals, given the statements from the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, to fully **solidify the claim**, I'd like to emphasize that this conclusion is based on secondary evidence and indirect attributions, rather than primary sources.\n\nLet's categorize the evidence supporting this claim as **indirect confirmation** from official reports and statements from the Trump administration. While indirect, this evidence still offers a strong indication of the intent behind the tariffs.\n\n**Recommendation:** For those interested in directly confirming the claim, seeking **primary sources** or direct quotes from Trump would be beneficial. For the purposes of this discussion, however, we can consider the claim as largely supported.",

Given your token limits have been exceeded, I appreciate your honesty and candor in acknowledging the limitations.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let's summarize our conversation on the previous claim about Donald Trump purposefully increasing tariffs. We discussed various aspects of the claim, including the intent behind the tariffs, the role of international trade policies, and the relevance of evidence from official reports and statements from the Trump administration.\n\nTo address your current claim, Donald Trump claimed he is greater than other countries is a broad statement that could encompass a range of contexts. If you had more space, I'd ask you to clarify which specific statement or situation you're referring to.\n\nHowever, considering our previous discussion, I can still provide some general guidance on how to approach evidence for this claim.\n\nTo support your claim, you could explore the following:\n\n1. **Specific quotes and statements**: Look for instances where Donald Trump made claims about being greater than other countries. Use reputable primary sources like news articles, interviews, or official transcripts.\n2. **Contextualize the claims**: Consider the context in which these claims were made. Were they part of a speech, a tweet, or an interview? What were the circumstances, and who was the intended audience?\n3. **Evaluate the claims**: Assess the validity and implications of these claims. Are they based on factual data or anecdotal evidence? How do they relate to his broader policy goals and rhetoric?\n4. **Seek official documentation**: Look for official reports, documents, or statements from the White House or relevant government agencies that detail Trump's views on international comparisons.\n\nIf you're willing, we can revisit this claim in a future conversation once you've had a chance to expand on the context and gather more evidence.",
