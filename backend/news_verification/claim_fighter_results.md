This photo shows former U.S. President Donald Trump holding up a large sign detailing "Reciprocal Tariffs."  He is in mid-speech, his mouth slightly open, and appears to be presenting the information on the sign to an audience.

Trump wears a dark suit jacket, white shirt, and solid red tie. He holds the sign with his right hand.  A microphone is positioned in front of him.  A blurred American flag is visible in the background.

The sign itself is dark, possibly black, with gold trim.  The title "Reciprocal Tariffs" is prominently displayed at the top, along with a circular presidential seal. Below the title, a table lists countries in a light blue/teal font and corresponding tariff percentages in white, organized in two columns. The left column lists various countries, including China, European Union members, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, and the United Kingdom. The right column displays percentages, seemingly representing the tariffs charged by those countries to the U.S.  A smaller header above this column clarifies that these figures include aspects like currency manipulation and trade barriers.  A third, partially visible column on the far right contains another set of gold-colored percentages.

Donald Trump is unpredictable. After urging Americans to ‘be cool’ amid markets slumping over his tariff policy, he made a shocking pivot on Wednesday. He announced a 90-day pause for all countries except China. But what led the US president to change his mind? Was it the rapid rise in government bond yields or the rising criticism from billionaires and business leaders? read more

US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick look on in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9. Trump announced that he was pausing the higher tariffs on countries, barring China, for 90 days. AFP

“Don’t be weak, don’t be stupid, don’t be a panican,” US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday, in response to a growing number of people expressing concern over his tariff policy.

The following day, he told Republicans, “I know what the hell I’m doing” as the massive tariffs he had imposed sent global markets into a tailspin. Moreover, he also revelled in the fact that world leaders were “dying to make a deal”, adding that they were “kissing my a*s.”

And on Wednesday morning, Trump once again wrote a social media post, “Be cool. Everything is going to work out well,” in response to his tariffs.

But hours later, he shocked the world and his own people when he announced a 90-day pause in the higher rate of “reciprocal tariffs”, barring China, that had been in force for a mere 13 hours. When asked what brought about the turnaround, Trump said, “They were getting yippy. They were getting a little bit yippy, a little afraid.”

As the markets jump back following Trump’s reversal, we take a closer look at what exactly led the US president to change his mind on his pet topic — tariffs.

Markets matter — they really do

If there was one driving factor behind Trump’s tariff reversal it has to be the markets and how they have performed since April 2 — the day he announced his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.

When the tariffs went into effect last Wednesday, the markets tanked. Then came investor fears of a ‘ Black Monday’. It is reported that Trump’s tariffs wiped off $10 trillion (£7.8 trillion) of global share prices in a matter of days.

But that didn’t rattle the US president, much.

However, on Wednesday, things drastically changed for Trump. The US witnessed a sharp sell-off in US government bond markets, which is usually a safe corner for investors. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time, the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.

This was of particular concern to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, whose finance career was deeply intertwined with the bond market. According to one administration official, it was Bessent who then urged Trump to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market.

Later, while announcing his 90-day pause, Trump even acknowledged the bond market, saying, “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.”

Criticism rings loud and clear

But the markets weren’t the sole factor influencing Trump’s decision on the tariff pause. Trump also was contending with massive criticism from business leaders, billionaires — people he could normally bank on for support.

For instance, billionaire hedge fund boss and previously a Trump backer — Bill Ackman — turned on the president, warning that his tariffs risked an “economic nuclear winter”.

In fact, Ackman, as The Telegraph reports, is the origin of Trump’s 90-day pause. He had earlier taken to social media, asking Trump to put a 90-day pause on tariffs, arguing the president can “accomplish his objectives without destroying small businesses in the short term”.

In a lengthy post on X, Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, issued a dire warning of what could happen if the tariffs weren’t halted immediately. “If the president doesn’t pause the effect of the tariffs soon, many small businesses will go bankrupt,” Ackman wrote. “Medium-sized businesses will be next.”

Trump’s ‘First Buddy’ Elon Musk also seemed to be unhappy with the tariff policy. Trump’s Doge leader had spent recent days slamming the tariff decision and mocking Peter Navarro, the president’s advisor on trade matters, in deeply personal terms. In fact, Musk went as far as calling Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.

And it seems that JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also played an instrumental role in changing Trump’s mind. On Wednesday, around 8 am, Trump watched the Dimon give an interview to Fox News in which he cautioned that a recession was a “likely outcome” given the economic uncertainty, explaining that he was hearing from most everyone he spoke to that they were “cutting back” as a result.

“Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right,” Dimon told Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo. He added, “I’m taking a calm view, but I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here.”

Deal mania runs high in the White House

It’s also reported that the tariff pause came as Trump’s team struggled to cope with the countries trying to make a deal. As The Times reported, they simply could not cope with the whirlwind that Trump had unleashed.

Moreover, executives had been flooding the phone lines of Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to make the case to Trump directly.

In a Bloomberg report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that the flood of outreach from other countries making “the right kind of offers” also played a role. The media outlet reported that Trump was particularly intrigued that countries were beginning to offer concessions that hadn’t previously been on the table, including addressing non-tariff trade barriers. “It just became crazy, the amount of calls we got,” Lutnick said.

Trump reverses his decision

All of this put together led to Trump swaying and he decided that he would pause the tariffs. Trump then sat down with Lutnick and Bessent and drafted a social media post to tell the world that he was, for now, rolling back the tariffs.

After the announcement, Trump aides raced to declare that it had been the strategy all along. Bessent said the change of tack wasn’t driven by market volatility, and was instead about a desire to tailor new trade deals with affected trading partners that have been flooding the White House with requests to negotiate. “It is just a processing problem,” said Bessent. “Each one of these solutions is going to be bespoke, it is going to take some time, and President Trump wants to be personally involved, so that’s why we’re giving the 90-day pause.”

Trump later said that the decision to change course on his tariff plan came “from the heart”. He said, “Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it. I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up, I didn’t — we didn’t have the use of — we didn’t have access to lawyers … We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too.”

Trump’s decision has definitely given the world some breathing space — at least for the next 90 days. What comes next, no one knows.

## Debate Results

### Claim: Donald Trump purposefully increased tariffs.

#### Round 1

**DeepSeek Response:**

```


The claim that "Donald Trump purposefully increased tariffs" is **True**. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Deliberate Action:** During Trump's presidency, there were deliberate actions to increase tariffs. This was part of a broader strategy to address perceived trade imbalances, particularly with China. Trump frequently discussed these measures as part of his "America First" policy, aiming to protect domestic industries and bring jobs back to the U.S.

2. **Trade War Context:** The increase in tariffs was a key component of the U.S.-China trade war. Trump's administration implemented tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods, which were reciprocated, leading to significant discussions on the economic impacts on various sectors.

3. **Official Documentation:** The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and other government agencies documented these tariff increases. News outlets and independent analyses, such as those from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, covered the implementation and effects of these tariffs.

4. **Policy Continuity:** The continuation of certain tariffs under subsequent administrations, though with modifications, underscores that these were strategic decisions rather than arbitrary actions.

In conclusion, the evidence from official sources, media coverage, and policy analyses supports the conclusion that Donald Trump purposefully increased tariffs as part of his administration's trade strategy.
```

**Llama Response:**

```
**Analysis and Line of Questioning:**

I acknowledge the presence of evidence in the explanation but remain unconvinced by the weak and indirect measures that support the claim. To strengthen this argument, I request clarification and specific, authoritative sources to decisively settle the claim.

1. **Deliberate Action Point:**
   Although you mention deliberate actions to increase tariffs, I need **detailed, primary sources** to confirm the specific dates and implementation details of these decisions. What primary documents or testimony can you provide to support the notion that Trump purposefully increased tariffs, rather than a response to changing circumstances? 

2. **Trade War Context:**
   It's true that the U.S.-China trade war involved tariff increases, but I'd like you to clarify whether these increases were **initial or reactive** measures during Trump's presidency. How do you rule out the possibility that tariff actions escalated inadvertently, particularly given the tit-for-tat nature of trade wars? 

3. **Official Documentation:**
   While you mention documentation by the USTR and other government agencies, I'd need **verbatim statements** or **exact quotes** from these documents that explicitly state Trump's intention to purposefully increase tariffs. You mention news outlets and independent analyses; could you cite **primary sources** that directly link Trump to the decision-making process for specific tariff increases?

4. **Policy Continuity:**
   While it's plausible that subsequent administrations continued tariffs with modifications, **how can you establish a clear causal link** between Trump's strategic trade decisions and the continuation of tariffs under the next administration? Ensure you address possible counterarguments, such as the role of changing economic conditions or other policy developments.

**Additional Request:**
I'd appreciate it if you could specifically address the potential **motivations behind Trump's tariff increases**, such as whether he saw them as a strategic means to obtain concessions or impose punishment. A more nuanced understanding of these dynamics can clarify the purpose behind Trump's actions and add depth to this line of argumentation.

Let's engage further by establishing a clear evidence base that justifies the claim that Trump purposefully increased tariffs.

{'status': 1, 'gemini_reason': "DeepSeek provided an initial argument that, while accurate, lacked specific sourcing to support the claim that Donald Trump 'purposefully' increased tariffs as a strategic move.

### Claim: The tariff increase was to show he is greater than other countries.

#### Round 1

**DeepSeek Response:**

```


The claim that "the tariff increase was to show he is greater than other countries" is a simplification of the motivations behind Donald Trump's tariff policies. While there was an element of asserting U.S. strength and dominance in Trump's approach to trade, the primary reasons for the tariff increases were more multifaceted. These included addressing perceived unfair trade practices by China, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, reducing the trade deficit, and protecting domestic industries. The impact of these tariffs was also complex, leading to both changes in trade practices and retaliatory measures from other nations. Therefore, while Trump's rhetoric often emphasized American strength, the primary motivations for the tariff increases were rooted in economic protectionism and trade negotiations rather than solely demonstrating U.S. superiority.
```

**Llama Response:**

```
**Analysis and Line of Questioning:**

While I acknowledge that your revised explanation provides a more nuanced understanding of Trump's tariff policies, I still need **clearer justifications** and **authoritative sources** to support the claim that these motivations were primary.

1. **Addressing Unfair Trade Practices:**
   I'd like to know more about the specific evidence of **intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers** by China. You may have mentioned that these were perceived practices by Trump's administration, but **can you provide concrete examples** of instances when China engaged in these activities? What documentation or testimony supports this claim?

2. **Economic Protectionism and Trade Negotiations:**
   While it's true that Trump's rhetoric often emphasized American strength, how do you definitively rule out that this aspect was a key driver of the tariff increases? **Survey data** or **opinion polling** might reveal the extent to which the public believed the U.S. was at a disadvantage in trade. More importantly, were there **specific concessions** or **diplomatic breakthroughs** in trade negotiations resulting from the tariff increases?

3. **Complex Impact of Tariffs:**
   I agree that the impact of the tariffs was complex. However, how do you pinpoint a **causal link** between tariff increases and the changes in trade practices and retaliatory measures? **Studies** or **analyses** that examine the feedback loops and outcomes of the tariffs would support this claim.

4. **Primary Motivations:**
   I'd appreciate clarification on **how you distinguish between primary and secondary motivations** for the tariff increases. What specific data or evidence leads you to conclude that economic protectionism and trade negotiations were the primary drivers, rather than, say, Trump's perceived desire to assert American strength?

**Additional Request:**
Consider addressing potential counterarguments, such as:

* **Timeline analysis:** How does the sequence of events between Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent trade talks/concessions reinforce the idea that the tariffs were primarily driven by economic protectionism?

Let's continue to engage in a more informed discussion by applying further scrutiny to the motivations and impacts of the tariff increases.
