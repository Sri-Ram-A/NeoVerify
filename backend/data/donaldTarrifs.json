He appears to be mid-speech, with his mouth slightly open. A microphone is positioned in front of him.\n\nThe sign he holds displays a list of countries and percentages under the heading \"Reciprocal Tariffs\". A small Presidential Seal is at the top left of the sign.  The subheading \"Country\" is followed by a list of nations including China, European Union, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, and the United Kingdom. Each country name is paired with a percentage in white text within a light blue rectangle.  To the right of these percentages, another column of percentages in a gold/tan rectangle exists under the heading \"Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A.\" which includes a smaller subheading: \"(Including Currency Manipulation and Trade Barriers)\".\n\nIn the background, a blurred American flag is visible, providing a patriotic backdrop to the scene. The lighting is bright, suggesting a daytime outdoor setting."

While Trump has discussed reciprocal trade policies, particularly during his presidency, there is no concrete evidence, such as photos or credible reports, showing him holding a sign with that exact wording. \n\n**Sources Needed:**\n- Photos or videos of Trump holding a sign with the specific text 'Reciprocal Tariffs'.\n- Eyewitness accounts or official reports from events where such a sign was displayed.\n\nWithout these sources, the claim remains unverified.",
            "llama_response": "Claim is: Donald Trump is holding a sign displaying 'Reciprocal Tariffs'.\nOpponent's response: **Initial Response:**\n\nThe fact-checker has appropriately labeled this claim as \"unverified\" due to the lack of concrete evidence. However, I would like to challenge the assumption that the available evidence is solely limited to photos or credible reports. \n\nI propose that we extend the scope of our search to include other sources, such as:\n\n1. **Transcripts**: Do we have transcripts from rallies, speeches, or interviews where Trump mentioned reciprocal trade policies? These transcripts might not explicitly show the sign but could mention the policy or language in relation to it.\n2. **Speeches and video archives**: What if the sign is not explicitly shown in the available footage, but the wording or mention of the policy is referenced in the context of the event?\n3. **White House or official documents**: Has the White House or any relevant department released documents or statements mentioning the policy in relation to the sign?\n4. **Alternative reporting or commentary**: Have media outlets, experts, or commentators mentioned the sign or related to it? Their reporting might not necessarily verify the claim but could offer additional context.\n\n**Requesting Clarification:**\n\nWhile eyewitness accounts and official reports would indeed strengthen the claim, can we at least confirm whether Trump's administration or relevant officials ever mentioned or acknowledged using signs with the phrase \"Reciprocal Tariffs\"?\n\n**Requesting More Sources:**\n\nIn addition to photos or videos of the sign, can we request:\n\n1. **Media archives**: Access to media archives from the time period when the claim might have occurred.\n2. **Speech and presentation data sets**: Access to data sets containing information about Trump's speeches, rallies, or events, which might contain references to the sign or policy.\n3. **Social media analysis**: Analyzing social media posts, official accounts, and hashtags related to Trump's events, might reveal other evidence.\n\n**Acknowledging Strong Points:**\n\nThe fact-checker's emphasis on the need for concrete evidence to verify the claim is well-founded and strengthens our process. However, we must also consider the possibility that the sign might not be explicitly shown but still valid.\n\nPlease clarify the potential findings from these additional sources, or if no new information becomes available, the claim will remain unverified as per the initial response.",

Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told CNN. [...] Despite rattled financial markets, threats of retaliation and some of President Donald Trump’s biggest supporters encouraging him to back off his signature economic policy, he didn’t give in. His administration piled on heaps of new “reciprocal” tariffs Wednesday on dozens of American allies and adversaries alike, aiming to — as he claims — restore fairness and boost American manufacturing.",

It may be beneficial to seek external expertise or conduct a more in-depth investigation to resolve this claim's status.\n\n**Limitations and Next Steps:**\n\nGiven the recurring token limit issue, it's challenging to proceed further with the investigation.
